"""
Exercise 3
Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

1) Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from 
this list in it and print out this new list.
2) Write this in one line of Python.
3) Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list 
that are smaller than that number given by the user.
