"""
Exercise 12
Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) 
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
For practice, write this code inside a function.

Concepts to practice
Lists and properties of lists
List comprehensions (maybe)
Functions
