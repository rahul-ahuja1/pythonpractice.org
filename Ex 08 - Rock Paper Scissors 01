Exercise 8
Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
(Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations 
to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:

1) Rock beats scissors
2) Scissors beats paper
3) Paper beats rock
