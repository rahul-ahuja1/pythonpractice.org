"""
When appropaching problems like this one, it helps to develop a plan for the program before executing it.

Our plan should be as follows:
1) Use the requests library to load the HTML of the page into Python
2) Set up BeautifulSoup to process the HTML
3) Find out which HTML tags contain all the titles
4) Use BeautifulSoup to extract all the titles from the HTML
5) Format them nicely
