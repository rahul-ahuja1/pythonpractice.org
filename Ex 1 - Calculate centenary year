"""
Exercise 1 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:
1) Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and 
printing out that many copies of the previous message. 
(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
2) Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 
(Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

import datetime
name = input("Enter name: ")
age = input("Enter age: ")
age = int(float(age)//1) # to adjust any decimal age input
now = datetime.datetime.now() # gets current time using datetime package
centenary_year = int(now.year) + (100 - age)
msg = name + " will complete 100 years in the year: " + str(centenary_year)
print("-"*50)
print(msg)

# Extras
print("-"*50)
rep = input("Enter another no.: ")

print("-"*50)
