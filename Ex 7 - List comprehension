Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements 
of this list in it.

# The idea of a list comprehension is to make code more compact to accomplish tasks involving lists.
# Take for example this code:

years_of_birth = [1990, 1991, 1990, 1990, 1992, 1991]
ages = []
for year in years_of_birth: 
        ages.append(2014 - year)
        
print(ages)

""" List comprehension """
ages = [2014 - year for year in years_of_birth]
# The second line here - the line with ages is a list comprehension.
# The idea of the list comprehension is to condense the for loop and the list appending into one simple line.
